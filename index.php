            <h1>  BINGO WORLD </h1>
            <p> Bingo is a popular and simple game of chance that is often played as a form of entertainment
                and social activity.<br> <br>
                It is commonly played in various settings, including bingo halls, community centers, fundraisers, and even online. The game involves players marking off numbers on a                         pre-printed grid or card as they are randomly called out. The objective of the game is 
                to achieve a specific pattern of marked numbers on the card before other players do.
               <br><br>
                Bingo is known for its simplicity and accessibility, making it a popular choice for social gatherings, charity events, and even as a form of gambling in some                               jurisdictions. It's a game that combines luck and concentration, as players need to pay close attention to the numbers being called to win.
